# ‚ö° FLEXFIRE-X: EMG-Controlled Cyberware-Inspired Projectile System

A wearable, servo-powered arm attachment that extends and fires a spring-loaded projectile using EMG muscle signals‚Äîbuilt to mimic the immersive cyberware experience of *Cyberpunk 2077*.

## üöÄ Overview

**WRISTLAUNCH-X** is a bio-integrated device that mounts on the user's forearm and responds to intuitive muscle movements:

- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Wrist rotation** (palm down) ‚Üí **Barrel extends**
- üí™ **Forearm flexion** ‚Üí **Projectile fires**

This project explores how EMG signals can control physical actuators to feel like a seamless extension of the human body.

## üß† Concept & Inspiration

Inspired by the **Projectile Launch System** from *Cyberpunk 2077*, this prototype brings sci-fi to life with:

- EMG-based gesture control
- A concealed-to-exposed transformation mechanism
- Arduino-powered spring-loaded projectile launch

## üí™ EMG Signal Detection
- Electrodes placed over the *flexor carpi radialis* muscle on the forearm help detect proper movement of the wrist and forearm flexion.
- Muscle signals are filtered via moving average to produce more stable results.
- Three flexion states are used for control:
  - **Low Flexion (<50)** ‚Üí Barrel stays retracted
  - **Medium Flexion (>50)** ‚Üí Barrel extends
  - **High Flexion (>500)** ‚Üí Projectile is launched

## üîß 3D Design

The FLEXFIRE-X uses a total of nine 3D printed components that were designed in Blender and printed in PLA. 

An exploded view of the device shows the layout of each part:

## üî´ Launching Mechanism

The projectile is launched using a spring-loaded barrel system controlled by a servo-actuated locking mechanism. Here's how it works:

1. The rocket is inserted into the barrel, with its fins aligning with internal grooves to ensure proper orientation and constrain its rotation.
2. As the rocket is pushed in, the spring compresses, storing potential energy.
3. A servo rotates a locking rod, holding the rocket securely in place under spring tension.
4. When the servo rotates back to its original position, the lock is disengaged, allowing the spring to decompress and launch the rocket forward.
5. **Note:** To increase launch force, multiple springs can be nested concentrically within the barrel.
